  		<p class="content">Usually, CSS is written in a separate CSS file {with file extension .css} or in a "style" tag inside of the "head" tag, but there is a third place which is also valid. The third place you can write CSS is inside of an HTML tag, using the style attribute. When CSS is written using the style attribute, it’s called an “inline style”. In general, this is not considered a best practice. However, there are times when inline styles are the right {or only} choice.</p>
